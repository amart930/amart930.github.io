        <div class="subheading mb-5">Translation helper üìö</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Over this school year I have not worked anywhere, I have been focusing on myself trying to get my english classes passed and then I was thinking of applying for a job.The job I would like to start off is at the dining restaurants at UCR. I have seen a lot of communication and socializing with other students which is very helpful if after college I want to start a bakery. There are other places in which I have been looking for such as a bakery but I feel like it would be a bigger step and right now based on how I haven‚Äôt gotten out of being shy, I am not really good at socializing. I think the best route to take is starting in a small place where I know some people and just go from there. Opening a bakery is only a side job I would like to have, but as for what I am majoring in I like to be a translator to people would need help, wether it being in clinics, hospitals, or other places.<br><br>

        Creating my own bakery or working in a bakery is my ultimate goal, and even though it is different from what I am majoring in, the plan in mind is to get a job where my major is applicable. With the money I gain I would then save it to create my own bakery or go to baking school and then focus on creating a bakery. I am willing to work as hard as I am doing so in college to build and manage my own bakery. A bakery has always been my goal from the beginning and it's a wish that I won't back down on. A bakery where people can not only enjoy the delicious pastries and coffee but a place where customers can come and read books or even do there homework there. It would be a environment where customers would find calmness. My bakery would be called ‚Äú Mimmi‚Äôs Enjoyment Cafe‚Äù. The name Mimmi representing what my family from Mexico call me and the enjoyment refers to the joy the customer will take when existing and entering the bakery. I am really looking forward to starting this bakery.<br><br>

        In this last section I like to provide facts about me. I am a college student who is soon to be 20, loves baking, and is a cancer survivor. My life has been a life where many obstacles were faced but it didn't stop me from attending college, and I will not stop after college I will keep going and I will have my own bakery. College so far has been an adventure where there were points where I just wanted to give up and there has also been many emotional events in college that has happen. But I just keep remembering my goal and I just keep going. I hope that I can get many customers, and when you visit my business I guarantee you that you will come back. I can do it!
